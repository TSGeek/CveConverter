# CveConverter

A small utility for converting [CVEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) from JSON to CSV. It also select what values we want in order to make some statistics in them.
This project has been created for our work on a big data course at UTBM.

## Data
This software is based on the [CVE Json Schema V5](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema).

## How to use it ?
1. Put all data from the [archive of the mitre](https://www.cve.org/Downloads) in the CVES folder on C Drive (you can change it in the program if needed)
2. Run the software
3. The generated CVE will be created where the executable is ran
